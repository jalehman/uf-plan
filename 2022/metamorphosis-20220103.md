# Complete metamorphisis into a standalone organization

The UF has been around for a little while as a proto-organization within Tlon,
but this year it has become a standalone organization which comes with its own
set of new challenges. Many aspects of running an organization have been handled
for us by Tlon, and now there's a lot of maturing that we need to do fairly
rapidly.

Some of this is actually novel and UF-specific, like finalizing our board of
directors, but most of this is fairly run-of-the-mill operational legwork. It's
not particularly exciting, and not the reason we're all here, but this work has
to be done.

Everyone we employ will be employed as a contractor with whom we consult with
via an entity that they own. This keeps our operations simple, which is
important given the many different jurisdictions that we employ people within.

Obviously, employing people is important.
