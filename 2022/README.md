# 2022

Here's the plan for 2022.

## Q1: ~2022.1.3 - ~2022.4.1

### Complete metamorphosis into a standalone organization

The UF has been around for a little while as a proto-organization within Tlon,
but this year it has become a standalone organization which comes with its own
set of new challenges. Many aspects of running an organization have been handled
for us by Tlon, and now there's a lot of maturing that we need to do fairly
rapidly.

Some of this is actually novel and UF-specific, like finalizing our board of
directors, but most of this is fairly run-of-the-mill operational legwork. It's
not particularly exciting, and not the reason we're all here, but this work has
to be done.
